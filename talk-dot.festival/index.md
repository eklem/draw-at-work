# Long version
## How to teach a million people to draw to communicate. Maybe...
The story about the quest to create a DIY drawing workshop that people will actually use, learn from and find usefull in their work. So both teaching people to draw to communicate and make the workshop setup scale to a lot more people than what I can ever meet in person, accumulated through my lifetime.And also, I don't want to be "the drawing guy" for the rest of my life. I think I have a knowledge that others could benefit a lot from. How to make that happen?

* The visual alphabet: What is it, and why was it created? 
  To remove the burden of figuring out how to draw things and what they really look like by communicating through more symbol-like drawings.
  Many visual alphabets, this is Dave Gray's visual alphabet.

* Why teach yourself to draw 
  * What's the purpose of drawing at work?
  * How I taught myself to draw for work purposes
  Learnt it at a previous company after a colleague told about a talk based on "The visual alphabet"
  Drew a lot to communicate better with team members and stakeholders
* Figuring I could teach others
  It turns out, almost no interaction designers can draw. And it's a valuable skill for any tech team member.
  Whiteboard workshops at IF insurance company. Fun, but a lot of work to teach a handfull of people to draw for work purposes.
* First take on making it scale - DIY workshop setup
  Main thought was that it could maybe reach people when the thought about drawing was already there.
  Wrote some blogposts on how to facilitate this as a workshop yourself or for you team.
  But, few people read blogposts. And a blogpost is just talking about what I want to make, not actually being the thing. So, even fewer do what's suggested in the blogpost.

* Covid: Online workshops in Miro still doesn't scale
  Scaling as bad as whiteboard workshops.
  Turns out only about 12 people can draw at the same time in Miro. Then you start to get syncing issues.
  Miro getting more and more bloated. Always interesting to start a workshop session only to discover that the features I was depending on had changed. And stuff I didn't need was added.
  And takes a lot more energy to engage people compared to be in the same room as them
* Making it more useful in a work setting
  Design critique and drawing battle.
* What the future may hold - tldraw
  * Found tldraw on Github in 2021, when I needed a drawing tool for a presentation, and I didn't have a license on Adobe Illustrator anymore.
  * I understand that tldraw and VSCode could actually work technically. Without the need for any code.
  * I can code. A little. But often it's good to wait for technology to happen, so you don't have to create too much yourself.
  * Save a workshop setup you could continue to draw on. Not a blank screen as you get when going to tldraw.com
