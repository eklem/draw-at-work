# The visual alphabet

*Key takeaway: Understand that you can communicate with your drawings.*

In this workshop you’ll learn the basics for drawing to communicate. These simple steps will be good to know when you want to draw quickly and/or don’t think you can draw. For this we’ll use the Visual Alphabet as a handy tool. It will take away a lot of the difficulties to try to figure out how to draw things.
