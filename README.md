# Draw at work!
Workshops to learn how to draw to communicate. And structure your ideas. Not art, but communication. Everyone can. Doesn't need to be pretty. Communicate better within teams and stakeholders.

How far I've gotten with the [Draw at work workshop](https://eklem.github.io/draw-at-work/).


## Why?

1. To think better and sort your ideas
2. To communicate your ideas to others

## 3 basic workshop sessions

For each workshop session, explain quickly what you'll learn and why it's needed.

### The visual alphabet

To make drawing easier without thinking too much, use a visual alphabet to simplify the process. We will use [Dave Gray's visual alphabet](https://medium.com/the-xplane-collection/in-defense-of-the-visual-alphabet-a8dcca7cf151).

### Draw fast

How to simplify and when to add details.

### Human beeings and interaction

We create software to help people. For this we often need to explain interactions between people or people and machines.

## Practicing

Drawing battles. Get better at telling stories that communicate well through drawing and design critique.

1. Choose a story. Write it down
2. Draw (all of you)
3. Design critique
4. Draw again

## React and Vite setup

React app can be found in the `/react` folder.
