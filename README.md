# Draw to communicate workshop setup
Templates and tools for workshops to learn how to draw to communicate. Not art, communication. Everyone can. Doesn't need to be pretty. Communicate better within teams and stakeholders.

## Prerequisite

### Install Visual Studio Code

Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Get the tldraw extension to Visual Studio Code

Search for the `tldraw` extension in Visual Studio Code, and install. tldraw is short for [Tiny little drawing app](https://www.tldraw.com/).

### Create a .tldr-file

Create a tldraw file type by using the file extention `.tldr`.

### Draw something!

You're good to go. Start drawing in tldraw and test the different functions.


## The 4 workshop sessions

For each workshop session, explain quickly what you'll learn and why it's needed.

### 1. The visual alphabet

To make drawing easier without thinking too much, use a visual alphabet to simplify the process. We will use [Dave Gray's visual alphabet](https://medium.com/the-xplane-collection/in-defense-of-the-visual-alphabet-a8dcca7cf151).

### 2. Draw fast

How to simplify and when to add details.

### 3. Human beeings and interaction

We create software to help people. For this we often need to explain interactions between people or people and machines.

### 4. Storytelling and design critique

Get better at telling stories that communicate well through drawing and design critique.
